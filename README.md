CalDAV SMS notifier
=====================

That node program fetch calendars from a CalDAV server, get next events and, for all of thoses, send an SMS as reminder.

The SMS notification service is the one my mobile service provider is offering ([Free mobile](http://mobile.free.fr/)). It is as simple to use as sending an HTTP request ([more info here](http://www.nextinpact.com/news/88097-avec-free-mobile-vos-appareils-connectes-peuvent-vous-envoyer-sms.htm)).

Tested with a [Baikal server](http://baikal-server.com/).
